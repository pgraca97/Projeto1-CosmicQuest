Often termed Earth's "twin" or "sister planet", Venus bears striking similarities to our home planet in terms of size, mass, and composition. As the second planet from the Sun, Venus orbits at an average distance of approximately 108 million kilometers (67 million miles) from our star. Its diameter is about 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles), making it only slightly smaller than Earth.

Venus is distinctive for its dense and thick atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide with traces of nitrogen and clouds of sulfuric acid. This heavy atmospheric blanket creates a strong greenhouse effect, causing surface temperatures to soar higher than any other planet in our solar system, averaging around 465 degrees Celsius (869 degrees Fahrenheit).

The planet's surface is shrouded by this thick, opaque cloud cover, preventing a direct view of its terrain from space using visible light. Yet, radar observations have revealed a surface riddled with volcanic features and craters. Venus also has no natural satellites.

Due to its brilliance and proximity, Venus is one of the most visible celestial bodies in our night sky, earning it the names "Morning Star" and "Evening Star." Despite its inhospitable conditions, Venus continues to be a compelling destination for scientific exploration, with studies of the planet offering invaluable insights into planetary climates, geological activity, and the potential for life beyond Earth.
