Venus presents a rich and varied geography that testifies to its tumultuous geological past. The surface of Venus, much like Earth, is divided into lowland plains, highland regions or 'continents', and scattered impact craters, though it lacks the plate tectonics that continuously reshapes Earth's surface.

The Venusian landscape is dominated by flat, volcanic plains that cover about 70% of the planet's surface. These vast plains are littered with an estimated 1000 to 1600 major volcanoes, though none are confirmed as currently active. The presence of these volcanic features, including expansive lava flows, shield volcanoes, and unique, pancake-like domes, hints at the planet's intense volcanic activity in the past.

Equally striking are the planet's highland regions, which account for about 10% of Venus' surface. The most prominent of these are the large, mountainous regions akin to Earth's continents: Ishtar Terra, located in the planet's northern hemisphere, and Aphrodite Terra, situated near the equator. Maxwell Montes, the highest peak on Venus and part of Ishtar Terra, towers at about 11 kilometers (7 miles) high, comparable to the height of Mount Everest.

One unusual feature of Venus' geography is the presence of circular structures known as coronae. These features, unique to Venus, are thought to be caused by the upwelling of hot material from deep within the planet's mantle.

Another distinctive aspect is the relative lack of impact craters, indicating a relatively young surface age of 300-600 million years. The craters that do exist are almost all relatively pristine, suggesting that the surface experienced a catastrophic resurfacing event after which the volcanic activity greatly decreased.

The geography of Venus, characterized by its extensive plains, towering mountains, and enigmatic volcanic features, continues to provide invaluable insights into the geological processes shaping terrestrial planets and contributes to our broader understanding of planetary evolution.
