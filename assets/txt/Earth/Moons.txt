Earth has a single natural satellite, our Moon, distinguishing it from many other planets in the solar system which either have multiple moons or none at all. The Moon, ranking as the fifth-largest moon in the solar system, has a diameter of about one-fourth that of Earth, making it relatively large compared to its host planet.

One of the most significant influences the Moon has on Earth is its gravitational pull, which is primarily responsible for the rise and fall of ocean tides. By creating tidal friction, the Moon also contributes to gradually slowing down the Earth's rotation, extending the length of our day over long geological timescales.

In addition, the Moon provides a stabilizing influence on the Earth's axial tilt or obliquity, which is a key factor in maintaining the planet's stable and life-supporting climate over millions of years. Without the Moon, variations in Earth's axial tilt could be more extreme, leading to severe climatic changes.

Beyond its effects on Earth, the Moon has long been a subject of human curiosity and scientific study. It is the only celestial body beyond Earth to have been visited by humans, with twelve astronauts having walked on its surface during NASA's Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972. These missions returned a wealth of scientific data about the Moon's composition, geological history, and potential for future exploration. The Moon continues to be a focus for human space exploration plans, offering a potential stepping stone for future missions to Mars and beyond.
