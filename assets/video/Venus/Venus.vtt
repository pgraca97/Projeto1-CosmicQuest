1
00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.760
named after the ancient roman goddess of

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.720
beauty

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.640
venus is known for its exceptional

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.840
brightness in the night sky

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.080
but behind this facade is a world of

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.960
storms and infernos unlike anywhere else

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.920
in the solar system

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.760
venus the second planet from the sun is

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.320
very similar to earth from a distance

10
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.519
but up close it's a very different world

11
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.679
venus is about the same size as earth

12
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.359
just slightly smaller

13
00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.920
its structure is also nearly identical

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.559
with an iron core a hot mantle and a

15
00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.960
rocky crust

16
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
the crust of venus however is dotted

17
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.280
with thousands of volcanoes including

18
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.239
maxwell montes a volcano almost as tall

19
00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.120
as mount everest

20
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.120
venus also has a thick layered

21
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.399
atmosphere

22
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.719
it's full of clouds that rain sulfuric

23
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.879
acid and whip around the planet at

24
00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.399
speeds up to 224 miles per hour

25
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.319
faster than some category 5 hurricanes

26
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.080
the atmosphere is so thick that it

27
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.000
creates a surface pressure similar to

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.920
what it would be about half a mile deep

29
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.799
in the earth's oceans this pressure is

30
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.960
heavy enough that a human standing on

31
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920
venus's surface would be crushed

32
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.759
the atmosphere is made of greenhouse

33
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.200
gases primarily carbon dioxide which

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.080
create an extreme case of global warming

35
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.479
they trap the sun's heat causing surface

36
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.600
temperatures to rise over 880 degrees

37
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.799
fahrenheit

38
00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.119
making venus the hottest planet in the

39
00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.840
solar system

40
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.400
venus is so inhospitable neither humans

41
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.479
nor spacecraft are able to survive the

42
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.000
planet's surface

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.240
but some scientists speculate that venus

44
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.799
wasn't always so unwelcoming

45
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.320
from roughly 2.9 billion to 715 million

46
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.960
years ago global temperatures on venus

47
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.040
may have been just a few degrees cooler

48
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.200
than earth's are today

49
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.799
and scientists theorized that the

50
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.640
surface may have contained shallow

51
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880
oceans that could have held enough water

52
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.520
to support life

53
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.640
today life may still exist in venus's

54
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.080
atmosphere

55
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.640
about 30 miles up in venus's clouds

56
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.400
where the temperature and surface

57
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.480
pressure are similar to those on the

58
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480
surface of earth scientists have

59
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.239
observed strange dark streaks that

60
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.239
appear to be absorbing ultraviolet

61
00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.720
radiation a phenomenon that could be

62
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.319
evidence of microbial life

63
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.239
life may struggle to survive in the

64
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.800
atmosphere of venus but it is this

65
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.640
unforgiving environment that's made

66
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.280
venus an icon of beauty

67
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.519
it reflects 70 percent of all the

68
00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.760
sunlight that reaches the planet which

69
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.400
is why venus shines more brightly than

70
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.720
any other planet or star in the night

71
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.040
sky

72
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.720
while more than 40 unmanned spacecraft

73
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.040
have visited this infernal world

74
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.080
venus

75
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.879
so illuminated in the darkness of space

76
00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.900
still has much to reveal

77
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:25.500
