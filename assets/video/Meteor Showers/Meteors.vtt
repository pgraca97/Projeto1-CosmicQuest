00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.400
nearly 50 tons of space debris crash

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.680
onto the earth every day

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.160
while some debris shyly dissipate into

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.480
the atmosphere

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.840
others display

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.920
a spectacular light show

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
meteor showers occur when the earth's

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320
orbit intersects with the orbit of a

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.519
comet

10
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.760
as comets travel they leave behind

11
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.560
trails of rocky material often times the

12
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.960
size of pebbles or grains of sand but

13
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.760
sometimes as large as boulders

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
every year the earth crosses these

15
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.320
trails of debris known as meteoroid

16
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.879
streams and the planet becomes sprinkled

17
00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.040
with rocky material

18
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120
the debris then race through the earth's

19
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.680
atmosphere creating friction with air

20
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160
particles and generating vast amounts of

21
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.120
heat

22
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.280
this heat vaporizes and illuminates the

23
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.840
debris as they fall creating streaks of

24
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.399
light in the sky popularly known as

25
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.800
shooting stars

26
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.959
these celestial light shows are often

27
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.040
named after the constellation where they

28
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.439
appear to originate as seen from earth's

29
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.960
surface

30
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.880
meteor showers that seem to fall from

31
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.360
the constellation perseus are called the

32
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.520
perseids and those appearing from the

33
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.600
constellation gemini are called the

34
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.680
geminids

35
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.240
about 30 meteor showers can be seen from

36
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.720
earth throughout the course of a year

37
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.560
and because the showers are timed with

38
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.119
earth's orbit the celestial phenomena

39
00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.280
are cyclical and occur at regular

40
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.479
intervals

41
00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.119
for example the perseid meteor shower

42
00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.600
happens every august and the geminid

43
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920
meteor shower happens every december

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.720
meteor showers have inspired awe and

45
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.040
admiration for millennia

46
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.200
in christian tradition the perseid

47
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.600
meteor showers symbolize the tears of a

48
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.560
saint saint lawrence who was executed in

49
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.439
august of the year 258

50
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.759
and in the first century a.d the

51
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.680
astronomer ptolemy believed that

52
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.000
shooting stars were a sign of the gods

53
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.840
looking upon mortals and listening to

54
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.560
their wishes

55
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.200
inspiring everything from making wishes

56
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.280
to reveling at the sky

57
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.840
meteor showers are a reminder of our

58
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.720
place in a dynamic and beautiful cosmic

59
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.720
ecosystem
