00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.360
while billions of stars are scattered

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.600
throughout the universe the one at the

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.240
center of our solar system

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.639
plays a special role for us here on

5
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.960
earth

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.320
our sun formed about 4.5 billion years

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.480
ago in the milky way galaxy's orion spur

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.039
it was born when a cloud of dust and gas

9
00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.000
known as a solar nebula collapsed and in

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the middle of this formation matter

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.160
condensed into a burning ball of gas

12
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.359
that became our sun

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.760
the sun's fiery nature along with a

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.160
tremendous gravitational pull and an

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.640
extensive magnetic field helped it to

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.239
become the heart of our solar system

17
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.160
the sun can be divided into six layers

18
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.039
or regions the corona

19
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.960
the chromosphere

20
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.719
the photosphere

21
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.280
the convective and radiative zones

22
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.800
and the core

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.440
in terms of atom count the sun is about

24
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.640
91 hydrogen the sun's fuel 8.9 helium

25
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.920
and 0.1 heavier elements such as carbon

26
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.030
and nitrogen

27
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.159
[Music]

28
00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.479
due to the sun's extreme temperatures

29
00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.040
these elements stay in a gas-like phase

30
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.840
called plasma

31
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.840
in the core

32
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.159
temperatures reaching at least 27

33
00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.960
million degrees fahrenheit combined with

34
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.840
the sun's powerful gravity fuse together

35
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.200
hydrogen molecules to create helium

36
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.439
called thermonuclear fusion this

37
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.840
releases an enormous amount of energy in

38
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.560
the form of radiation electricity

39
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.520
solar wind and as we experience on earth

40
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.119
life-giving heat and light

41
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.079
such volatility is contained thanks to

42
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.280
the sun's tremendous gravity

43
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.880
it's strong enough to hold the solar

44
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.280
system intact and is primarily due to

45
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.320
the sun's size and mass

46
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.119
our sun is the largest and most massive

47
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.679
object in the solar system

48
00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.040
it's more than 100 earths wide

49
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.599
and could theoretically fit all eight

50
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.599
planets inside

51
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.200
nearly 600 times

52
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.560
it also contains approximately 99.8

53
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.640
percent of all the mass in the solar

54
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.959
system

55
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.519
because of this mass the sun has a great

56
00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.760
pull on the fabric of space

57
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.680
creating a gravitational force that

58
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.080
causes nearby planetary bodies to be

59
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.040
drawn toward it this gravitational pull

60
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.519
allows the sun to hold together a system

61
00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.239
of eight planets potentially dozens of

62
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.319
dwarf planets at least 170 moons and

63
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.280
countless comets and asteroids

64
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280
without the sun's gravity these

65
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.519
celestial bodies would drift off into

66
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.170
deep space

67
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.320
[Music]

68
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.159
another critical property of the sun is

69
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.720
its magnetic field which encapsulates

70
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.760
the entire solar system

71
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.319
called the heliosphere this force field

72
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.480
protects the planets from harmful cosmic

73
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
radiation

74
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720
it's caused by the sun's plasma pushing

75
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720
electrically charged particles toward

76
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.400
the star's poles

77
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.879
this process turns the sun into a giant

78
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.040
magnet

79
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.879
although the sun's magnetic field is

80
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.360
invisible to the naked eye

81
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720
its effects are noticeable

82
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.959
on the sun's surface are dark areas

83
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.200
called sunspots which mark strong

84
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.480
pockets of magnetism

85
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.239
on earth and on some of the other

86
00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.480
planets the sun's magnetic field

87
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.560
interacts with their atmospheres

88
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.640
resulting in beautiful auroras

89
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.040
despite its size and strength the sun

90
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.239
will not last forever

91
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.920
in about 6.5 billion years it will run

92
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.400
out of its hydrogen fuel expand to

93
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200
envelop mercury venus and even earth and

94
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.920
then collapse into a small star known as

95
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.879
a white dwarf

96
00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:20.079
in the meantime the sun will continue to

97
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.320
play a critical role in the system that

98
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.160
bears its name

99
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.639
the sun's protective magnetic field

100
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.960
tremendous gravitational pull and

101
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.080
ability to create vast amounts of energy

102
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.120
will protect contain and give life to

103
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.840
our solar system
