00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.439
in ancient times

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.359
humans studied the night sky and

4
00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.680
discovered the worlds of mercury

another world shine brightly

13
00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.279
uranus is the seventh planet from the

14
00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.560
sun

15
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.199
from a distance of about 20 astronomical

16
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.238
units or 20 times the distance between

17
00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.200
earth and the sun uranus orbits the star

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.719
once every 84 earth years approximately

19
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.840
the length of a human's entire life

20
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.320
this orbit causes each season of uranus

21
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.320
to last that much longer

22
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.960
theoretically a human living on uranus

23
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600
would experience the four seasons only

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.719
once but each for about 21 years

25
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.199
partially due to its distance from the

26
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.359
sun uranus boasts the coldest

27
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.840
temperatures in the solar system

28
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.240
these icy temperatures dropping as low

29
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.439
as negative 370 degrees fahrenheit are

30
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.280
largely influenced by the planet's

31
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.799
composition

32
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.680
at about four earths wide uranus has an

33
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.680
earth-sized core made of iron and

34
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.840
magnesium silicate

35
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.320
the remainder approximately 80 percent

36
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.280
of uranus is a worldwide ocean of ices

37
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.840
made of water ammonia and methane the

38
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080
chemical behind the planet's cool blue

39
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.280
color

40
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.600
this icy composition prevents uranus

41
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.520
from emitting much heat compared to

42
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.000
other planets making the blue world the

43
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.840
solar system's coldest

44
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.479
in addition to its extreme temperatures

45
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.960
and orbit uranus has a dramatic

46
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.840
orientation

47
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.880
while the other seven planets spin on

48
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.759
their axes like tops uranus appears to

49
00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.680
roll along its equator

50
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.840
the planet is tilted at a near right

51
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.240
angle in which polar regions point

52
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880
toward and away from the sun rather than

53
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600
upward and downward

54
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.800
this tilt thought to be the result of

55
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.879
uranus's collision with at least one

56
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.560
celestial body

57
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.879
has also affected the orientation of

58
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.440
uranus's 13 rings and 27 known moons

59
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.120
unlike the rings and moons of other

60
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.200
worlds which orbit their home planets

61
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720
horizontally

62
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.040
those of uranus orbit in a vertical

63
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.360
orientation along the planet's tilted

64
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.800
equator

65
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.840
much like a ferris

66
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.920
wheel uranus and its many unusual

67
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.640
features were a mystery to the ancients

68
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640
and the planet was actually thought to

69
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.319
be a star

70
00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.040
but in the late 18th century astronomer

71
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.879
william herschel discovered that the

72
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.680
celestial object was actually a new

73
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.280
world

74
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.360
the scientific community debated over

75
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.519
what the planet should be called and

76
00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.920
eventually chose a name suggested by

77
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.680
astronomer johann alert bode

78
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.080
believed that since jupiter was the

79
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.159
father of the gods

80
00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.200
and saturn was the father of jupiter

81
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.800
then this new planet should be the

82
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.120
father of saturn

si luz

84
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.640
but rather than following the tradition

85
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.480
of using names from ancient roman

86
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.680
religion bode instead opted for celes's

87
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.599
ancient greek equivalent

88
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.040
uranus

89
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.440
uranus the ancient greek god of the

90
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.400
heavens was then latinized to be

91
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.040
uranus

92
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.560
to this day uranus is still the only

93
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.720
planet that veered from tradition with

94
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.760
an ancient greek namesake a status most

95
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.599
fitting for a planet beyond convention
