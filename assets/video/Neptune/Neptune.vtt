00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.919
along the dark edges of the solar system

2
00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:05.359
it floats

3
00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.000
anchored by a star but barely graced by

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.880
its warmth this traveler drifts alone as

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.840
deceptively calm and elusive as a deep

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.240
blue sea

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.600
neptune is the eighth planet from the

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.279
sun

9
00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.680
at about 30 times the distance between

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.240
our star and the earth or 30

11
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000
astronomical units

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.080
neptune is the most distant planet in

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.079
our solar system

14
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.559
this distance creates the longest orbit

15
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920
of the eight worlds about

16
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.399
165 years with the seasons lasting a

17
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.840
little over 40 earth years each

18
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.920
being so far away from the heat and

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.120
light of the sun neptune is cold dark

20
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.480
and icy

21
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.960
at its heart is a solid core about one

22
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.520
and a half times the size of earth

23
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.039
making up about 45 of the planet's mass

24
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.039
the core is made of water ice and

25
00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.480
silicate rock

26
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.479
the rest of the planet is believed to be

27
00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.600
a hot pressurized ocean of water methane

28
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.479
and ammonia ices surrounded by a layer

29
00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.680
of clouds these clouds predominantly

30
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.000
made of hydrogen and helium include

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.720
traces of methane which give this ocean

32
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.400
world its rich blue color

33
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.880
while the clouds create a cool calm

34
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.720
veneer from afar

35
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.040
up close they are whipped around by the

36
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.240
most severe weather in the solar system

37
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.759
winds on the planet reach speeds of over

38
00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.400
1200 miles per hour nearly five times

39
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.960
faster than the strongest winds recorded

40
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.479
on earth

41
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.119
in fact the winds are so powerful that

42
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.880
they break the sound barrier

43
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.600
drifting high above this windy ice giant

44
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.240
is a quiet ecosystem of rings and

45
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240
satellites

46
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.960
six rings encircle the planet with some

47
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.079
containing ring arcs or clusters of dust

48
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.920
particles in a ring

49
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.040
also revolving around the planet are 14

50
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.520
known moons with the largest called

51
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.800
triton

52
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.959
named after the sun of the ancient greek

53
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.080
sea god

54
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.640
triton has ice volcanoes and may even

55
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.640
contain a subsurface ocean

56
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640
much is left to be discovered about

57
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.599
neptune its rings and its moons

58
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.879
only one spacecraft voyager 2 has

59
00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.520
visited these cosmic bodies but future

60
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.400
missions to this mysterious icy world

61
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.239
would have even more stories to tell

62
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:56.509
