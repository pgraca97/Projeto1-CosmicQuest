00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.520
To the ancient Romans, the planet Mars

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.480
was symbolic of blood

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
and war.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.639
But to many people today,

5
00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.920
the red planet may hold the key

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.010
for a bright new future for humanity.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.359
The story of Mars began about 4.5

8
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.080
billion years ago when gas and dust

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.719
swirled together to form the fourth planet

10
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.160
from the Sun.

11
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.320
Mars is the second smallest planet in

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.879
the solar system with a diameter just

13
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.600
shy of the width of Africa.

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.239
In fact, its entire surface area is

15
00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.160
similar to that of all of Earth's

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.360
continents combined.

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.640
Much like its terrestrial cousin, Mars is

18
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.399
dense and has a rocky composition.

19
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.399
At the center of the planet is a core

20
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.199
made of iron, nickel, and sulfur, which may

21
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.680
have created a protective magnetic field

22
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.400
during Mars' earlier years.

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.799
Enveloping the core is a rocky mantle

24
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.720
made of silicate minerals

25
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.520
and a crust rich in iron.

26
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.840
These iron minerals react with the trace

27
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.479
amounts of oxygen in Mars's atmosphere

28
00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.759
and rust,

29
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.920
giving the planet its signature reddish

30
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.159
hue.

31
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.560
While its bloodlike appearance inspired

32
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.880
the ancient Romans to name Mars after

33
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.400
their god of war,

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
the planet's rusty color could be

35
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.400
considered symbolic of the planet's

36
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.270
prime days long past.

37
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.399
Today, Mars is dry, desolate, and cold, with

38
00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.840
temperatures dropping as low as negative

39
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.000
225 degrees Fahrenheit.

40
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.479
But billions of years ago, the planet was

41
00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.280
much warmer, more geologically active, and

42
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520
had a watery surface.

43
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.920
Lake beds and river valleys snake along

44
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.320
the face of Mars, indicating that liquid

45
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.410
water was for a time present.

46
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.038
Volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, the

47
00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:11.599
largest volcano in the solar system at

48
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.680
three times the height of Mount Everest,

49
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.200
once erupted lava.

50
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.640
But by about 50 million years ago, soon

51
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.280
after Earth's dinosaurs died out, Mars'

52
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.440
volcanoes also went extinct.

53
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760
Water on the Red Planet still exists

54
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.319
today, but mostly in the form of polar

55
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.720
ice caps.

56
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.560
Because of factors such as the presence

57
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.200
of water and Mars' similarity to Earth,

58
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.759
scientists have long speculated that

59
00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.320
there might be life on Mars.

60
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.280
However, we have yet to find clear evidence

61
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.840
of past or present extraterrestrial life.

62
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.240
Regardless, Mars may play a big role in

63
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.560
the future of human life.

64
00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.440
In the ongoing search for habitable

65
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.560
worlds, Mars is a prime target.

66
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.680
Not only could it potentially support

67
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.560
human life, but it may also help us

68
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.280
understand more about our own planet's

69
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.399
history and future.

70
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.760
As we venture further into the cosmos,

71
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.040
the red planet will continue to inspire

72
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.680
us, symbolizing not war, but hope.
