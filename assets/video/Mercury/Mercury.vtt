00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.970
The planet Mercury is named after

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.970
the messenger of the Roman gods,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.980
because even the ancients could see

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.433
how swift and fleeting it is in the sky.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.670
But it wasn't until recently that scientists

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.683
began unraveling Mercury's many mysteries.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.313
Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.740
It's diameter currently measures just over 3,000 miles,

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.090
about the size of the continental United States.

10
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.850
Like Earth, Mercury is a terrestrial planet

11
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.850
with three main layers, a core, a mantle, and a crust.

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.830
Only Mercury's crust has no tectonic plates.

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.310
Also, its iron core is enormous by comparison,

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.280
making up 85% of its radius,

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.250
while Earth's inner and outer core

16
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.120
account for just 55%.

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.160
Because of the core's exceptional size,

18
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.870
it's had a surprising influence

19
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.870
on Mercury's overall size, by causing it to shrink.

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.890
The hot iron core has slowly cooled and contracted

21
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.130
over the planet's 4.5 billion years.

22
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.160
In doing so, it pulled Mercury's surface inward,

23
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.650
and has caused the planet to shrink radially

24
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.523
by more than four miles.

25
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.680
This shrinking planet is also the planet closest to the sun,

26
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.330
orbiting our solar system's star at an average

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.363
distance of roughly 36 million miles.

28
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.550
Such proximity affects Mercury's atmosphere,

29
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.600
or rather, the lack of one.

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.260
It only has a very thin exosphere,

31
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.430
which is traditionally the outermost layer

32
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.800
of a planet's atmosphere.

33
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.700
This exosphere is made of oxygen, sodium,

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.660
hydrogen, helium, and potassium,

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.510
all whipped up from the planet's surface

36
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.873
by solar winds.

37
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.060
The lack of atmosphere and close proximity to the sun

38
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.170
also makes Mercury a planet of extremes.

39
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.920
The surface temperature can climb

40
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.560
to 800 degrees Fahrenheit during the daytime,

41
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.403
and fall to 290 degrees below zero at night.

42
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.720
Mercury's proximity to the sun is also the reason

43
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.293
behind it's ago old reputation of being swift and fleeting.

44
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.540
The sun's gravity pulls harder on Mercury

45
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.470
than any other planet, and like all planets,

46
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.720
Mercury travels in an elliptical orbit,

47
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.260
slowing down when it's father away from the sun,

48
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.423
and accelerating as it draws closer.

49
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.920
Clocking in at an average speed

50
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.510
of over 100,000 miles per hour,

51
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.083
Mercury slings around the sun in just 88 days.

52
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.800
From Earth, Mercury is difficult to observe

53
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.293
because it's fleeting and so close to the sun.

54
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.630
And so far, it's only been visited by two spacecraft,

55
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.423
NASA's Mariner 10 and Messenger.

56
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.960
Those missions gave us much of what we know today,

57
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.750
but future ventures are in the works

58
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.370
with high hopes of revealing

59
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.593
more of Mercury's secrets.
