00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.990
with its gold color and stunning rings

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.660
Saturn is quite a planetary gem Saturn

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.519
is the second largest of the eight

4
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.429
planets and it is about ten times as

5
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.410
wide as Earth despite its size saturn is

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.930
actually the lightest planet it is

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.330
predominantly made at the gases hydrogen

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.789
and helium and because of its particular

9
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.670
gaseous composition saturn is the only

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.949
planet in the solar system that's less

11
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.800
dense than water if the planet were

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.649
placed on an enormous ocean it would be

13
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.840
able to float

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.790
Saturn's gaseous makeup also means that

15
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.210
it has no true surface at its center the

16
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.210
planet has a dense core of water ice and

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.520
rocky material but it has no actual

18
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.739
landmass instead it's mostly made of

19
00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.500
gases liquids and yellow ammonia

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.930
crystals that swirl around the planet

21
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.430
creating golden clouds and storms the

22
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.619
largest storm on Saturn is at its North

23
00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.040
Pole it's over twice the size of Earth

24
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880
and shaped in a near-perfect hexagon

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.890
each of the six size is believed to be

26
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.259
the result of jet streams which all

27
00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.130
encircle a massive hurricane because of

28
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.619
Saturn's inhospitable environment the

29
00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.380
planet cannot support life but some of

30
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.750
its moons might Saturn has more than 50

31
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.810
confirmed moons and each varies in size

32
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.290
and terrain Enceladus one of Saturn's

33
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.990
smallest moons is covered in ice and

34
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.909
only about as wide as the state of

35
00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.659
Pennsylvania

36
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.170
Titan Saturn's largest moon is nearly as

37
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100
wide as Canada Titan is also the only

38
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.200
moon in the solar system with clouds and

39
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.530
a dense atmosphere both Titan and

40
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.020
Enceladus have underground oceans that

41
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.820
would make them potentially capable of

42
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.910
sustaining life Saturn's moons may also

43
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.860
play a role in shaping the planets

44
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.640
signature feature its rings Saturn's

45
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440
ring system is the largest and most

46
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.830
complex in the entire solar system the

47
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.989
rings are made of icy and rocky remnants

48
00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.630
from comets asteroids and moons the

49
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.549
particles range in size from being as

50
00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.170
small as dust to as big as mountains the

51
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.420
ring system is divided into seven groups

52
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.380
of rings

53
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.470
altogether there are as wide as four and

54
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.500
a half earths but only about two-thirds

55
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.400
of a mile thick how the Rings are able

56
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.250
to stay on track and intact has to do

57
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.069
with Saturn's smallest moons called

58
00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.260
shepherding moons these tiny satellites

59
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.109
orbit between the rings and they seem to

60
00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.850
use their gravity to shape the ring

61
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.340
material into circular paths Saturn has

62
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.380
fascinated scientists and amateur

63
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.019
astronomers alike for thousands of years

64
00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.049
the ancient Greeks and Romans who named

65
00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.000
the planet after the god of agriculture

66
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.870
believed it was a star it wasn't until

67
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.660
the 17th century after the telescope was

68
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.780
invented that scientists like Galileo

69
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.269
Galilei Christian Huygens and Giovanni

70
00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.560
Cassini could take a much closer look

71
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.720
only then was Saturn's planetary status

72
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.810
discovered and ultimately its many moons

73
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.530
and brilliant rings because of its

74
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.450
planet like moons light weight

75
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.760
composition and dazzling ring system

76
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.489
Saturn continues to mesmerize us to this

77
00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.760
day
