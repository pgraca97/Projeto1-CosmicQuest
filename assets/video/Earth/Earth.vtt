00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.439
earth

3
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.319
the only planet known to maintain life

4
00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.720
a product of scientific phenomena and

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.639
sheer chance

6
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.519
this blue speck in space holds the past

7
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.640
present and future of our very existence

8
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.720
approximately 4.5 billion years ago the

9
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.800
earth formed from particles left over

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.119
from the creation of our sun

11
00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.119
gravity drew these particles together to

12
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.679
form pebbles which then form boulders

13
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.719
and eventually the earth

14
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.960
at its heart is a solid inner core

15
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.280
covered by a liquid outer core

16
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.200
above this it's the mantle made of

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.000
flowing silicate rocks and a rocky crust

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.239
this rocky mass is the third planet from

19
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.399
the sun orbiting the star from an

20
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.120
average distance of about 93 million

21
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.879
miles

22
00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.960
it's close enough to the sun to be warm

23
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.199
unlike the cold gas giants

24
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.280
but not so close that its surface is

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.359
exposed to extreme heat and solar

26
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.130
radiation as is the case with mercury

27
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.439
[Music]

28
00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.280
earth's unique position in the solar

29
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.000
system allows it to house phenomena yet

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760
to be found anywhere else in the

31
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.560
universe particularly liquid surface

32
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.119
water and life

33
00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.680
according to one theory much of earth's

34
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.240
water is as old as its rocks both of

35
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.159
which having formed during the earth's

36
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.320
earliest days

37
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.240
because of earth's unique distance from

38
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.720
the sun the planet is able to contain

39
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.920
water in all of its forms liquid ice and

40
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.880
gas

41
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
rather than have them permanently frozen

42
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.640
or evaporated into space

43
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.000
but earth is the only known place in the

44
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
universe with liquid water on the

45
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.560
surface thereby having unique cascading

46
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560
effects on the planet

47
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.640
it hydrates the land helping create

48
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.560
nutrient-rich soil

49
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.200
it collects and pools to form oceans and

50
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.040
fresh water systems

51
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.759
and it cycles upward to add moisture to

52
00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.479
earth's protective atmosphere

53
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.840
and where there is liquid water

54
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.200
there is life

55
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.080
about 3.8 billion years ago in earth's

56
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.120
oceans

57
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.200
primitive life existed in the form of

58
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.680
microbial organisms

59
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.319
they and then suing billions of years

60
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.560
gave rise to a range of more advanced

61
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.440
life forms that thrived in earth's seas

62
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.480
lands and skies

63
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.280
as the only world known to harbor life

64
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.760
earth's biodiversity is expansive in

65
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.519
nature

66
00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.800
an estimated 1.5 million species of

67
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.840
plants

68
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.280
animals bacteria fungi and others have

69
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.400
been cataloged with potentially millions

70
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.480
if not billions more

71
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.280
yet to be discovered

72
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.319
home to life and fueled by water

73
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.599
earth houses a unique global ecosystem

74
00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.680
as curious and as grand as the

75
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.760
astronomical events that made them

76
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
possible
