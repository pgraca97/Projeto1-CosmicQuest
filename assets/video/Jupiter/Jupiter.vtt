00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.770
born from primordial Stardust 4.5

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.379
billion years ago Jupiter was the solar

3
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.290
system's first planet and much like its

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.630
namesake the king of the ancient Roman

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.450
gods Jupiter was destined for greatness

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.180
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.130
and the largest planet in the solar

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.340
system at approximately 11 Earth's wide

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.039
Jupiter has twice the amount of mass as

10
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.949
the other planets put together but

11
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.480
unlike Earth and the three other

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.239
terrestrial worlds Jupiter has no solid

13
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.520
surface it may not even have a

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.820
traditionally solid core rather this

15
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.800
giant planet may have a dense liquid

16
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.410
center surrounded by a worldwide ocean

17
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.640
of hydrogen and helium gases Jupiter's

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.890
gaseous composition can be observed in

19
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.579
its atmosphere about 44 miles thick the

20
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.680
atmosphere is a canvas of stripes and

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.140
storms churning across the giant planet

22
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.750
their colors range between shades of

23
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.049
whites yellows Browns and reds all

24
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.119
caused by the different chemical makeup

25
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.110
of each area probably the most iconic

26
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.450
feature of Jupiter is a crimson ground

27
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.000
storm that's been raging for over 300

28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420
years the Great Red Spot

29
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.189
it's a giant swirling collection of

30
00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.920
clouds with wind speeds of up to 400

31
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.380
miles per hour at least two and a half

32
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.450
times faster than category 5 hurricanes

33
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.530
floating hundreds of miles above the

34
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.950
storms of Jupiter are about 79 moons the

35
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.100
most of the eight known planets the four

36
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.990
largest moons were discovered by Galileo

37
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
in 1610 called the Galilean satellites

38
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.829
they include Io the most volcanic Li

39
00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.600
active celestial body in the solar

40
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.299
system Ganymede the solar system's

41
00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.579
largest moon even larger than the planet

42
00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.000
Mercury in Callisto and Europa which

43
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.640
along with Ganymede may contain oceans

44
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010
of liquid water on

45
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.820
their crusts Jupiter's large collection

46
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.889
of moons is only made possible by the

47
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.230
planets massive size and gravitational

48
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.050
pull the strongest of all the planets in

49
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.960
the solar system this incredible gravity

50
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.300
also implements the sizes of the seven

51
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.750
other planets during the solar system's

52
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.600
earliest days Jupiter being the first

53
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.060
planet to form attracted and destroyed

54
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.070
space debris that would have helped the

55
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.580
other planets grow in size today that

56
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.320
force may serve as a shield by

57
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.390
attracting comets and asteroids on to

58
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.820
Jupiter's own surface preventing them

59
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.800
from crashing onto inner planets like

60
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.030
Earth apart from the Sun Jupiter has

61
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.980
become the dominant figure in the solar

62
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.830
system thereby earning its place at the

63
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.290
top of the planetary heap as king

64
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:18.740
