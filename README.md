# Project 1: Cosmic Quest Escape Room
### Project Overview

Cosmic Quest is an educational escape room application, focused on the solar system. It's currently under development as part of the Project 1 course unit in the degree of Technologies and Information Systems for the Web at ESMAD, Portugal. The project's objective is to deliver an engaging learning experience by merging storytelling and gamification elements. Players will navigate through two unique rooms, solving challenges and learning about various celestial bodies.

### Usage

Once the application is launched, users can create an account and log in to commence gameplay. The application comprises two rooms; the first pertains to the inner planets along with two bonus challenges related to their moons and the Sun. The second room corresponds to the outer planets, with two bonus challenges linked to their moons and Small Celestial Bodies. Each room presents a distinct set of questions and educational content pertinent to the solar system.

### Project Status

Development of Cosmic Quest is presently ongoing, with regular updates soon to be posted on the project's GitHub repository. We are actively refining the gaming experience, incorporating new content, and enhancing the overall quality of the gamified application.

### Contribution Guidelines

Given that this project is part of a university course, contributions from external sources aren't accepted at this time. However, feedback and suggestions are most welcome.
