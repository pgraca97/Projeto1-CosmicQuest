# Projeto 1: Cosmic Quest Escape Room

### Project Overview

Cosmic Quest is an educational escape room game focused on the solar system, currently under development as part of the course unit Project 1 in the degree of Technologies and Information Systems for the Web at ESMAD, Portugal. The project aims to provide an engaging learning experience by combining storytelling, puzzles, and gamification elements. Players will explore different rooms while solving challenges and learning about various celestial bodies.

### Usage

After launching the application, users can create an account and log in to start playing the game. The game consists of three rooms, each with its own set of puzzles and educational content related to the solar system.

### Project Status

The development of Cosmic Quest is currently ongoing, with regular updates being made to the project's GitHub repository. We are actively working on refining the game experience, adding new content, and improving the overall quality of the gamified app.
